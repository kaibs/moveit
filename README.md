## Modified version of MoveIt!

forked from [ros-planning/moveit](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit.git).

Adapted `moveit_experimental` for directly publishing and executing joging-commands in RViz as an `trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory` message.

Intended for using with the `fake_controller` ([doc](http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/fake_controller_manager/fake_controller_manager_tutorial.html)) and activated `fake_execution`.

**this is just an temporary workaround which works in my specific setup to avoid other problems with RViz and Gazebo**
